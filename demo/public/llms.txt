# TailwindCSS Dither Plugin

> Safari‑compatible TailwindCSS plugin for adding performant, accessible dither effects without SVG filters. Provides utilities from `dither-xs` up to `dither-2xl` and a `dither` wrapper class for easy application.

This project ships as a CSS plugin you can import alongside TailwindCSS. Apply the `dither` class to a wrapper element (not directly to `img`, `video`, `iframe`, `canvas`, or `input`) to enable the effect on its contents. You can combine with utilities like `contrast-[1000%]` for vivid, colorized dithering. See links below for setup and usage details.
