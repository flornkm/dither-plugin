# TailwindCSS Dither Plugin (Safari Compatible)

A TailwindCSS plugin that provides Safari-compatible dither effects without relying on SVG filters making dithering easy, performant, and accessible.

## Usage

To start using the `dither-plugin`, install with the following command:

```
npm install dither-plugin
```

Then, add the plugin to your `index.css` file where you also reference TailwindCSS:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "dither-plugin";
```

To activate it, add a `<div>` around the elements that should be dithered and add the `dither` class to it.

```tsx
<div className="dither">
  <Component />
</div>
```

You can play around with different sizes, e.g. `dither-xl`.

Note that the class won't be applied when added directly to an img or video element, as these elements don't support `::after` pseudo-elements.

It's as easy as that! You can play around with it.
